## What is READ.ME?

#### A READ.ME file is a file that keeps information about the other files in the archieve of computer software. It's a form of documentation with just simple text named READ.ME. It is the first file that the user will read when opening a new program or software for the first time. It usually includes instructions or descriptions about the program. Just like this file you are reading right now is a README file explaining what I've learned about my time in this project.

## What is HTML?

#### Hypertext Markup Language, also known as HTML is a data format used to create documents that can be displayed in a web browser or website.

## What is Open-source design methodology?

#### Open-source design is code that is able to see and able to use depending on the license given. Companies usually open-source their code to show how they operate and give a sense of security and ensure consumers that their software is safe to use.

### Creative Computing

#### Creative computing is the inbetween section of creative arts and computing, it includes the community built surrounding it too.

### Physical Computing

#### Physical Computing is using physical objects and interacting with them by programming them from a computer. For this project we used Arduino which is a easy electronic platform that includes tutroials to teach you how to use and interact with these objects. 

# Research

#### To get around our project I did some research and looked at references to get a greater understanding of creative computing. I looked at different projects but these are ones that have stood out to me. 

### Digi-gxl

#### Digi-gxl is a community including womxn, intersex, trans folk and non-binary people that specialises in digital design such as 3D and XR known as extended reality. The platform acts as a agencey that supports networks and under represented creative computing artists to be seen. [Digi-gxl's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/digi.gxl/?hl=en)

### Experiments with Google

#### Experiments with Google is a collection with several open-sources experiments that help us find a balance with technology. It inspires designers to consider the actual wellbeing in their projects that they make. The open-sourced code allows a good base and guide to help designers to try out and reach to new ideas.

### ASCII Art

##### ASCII Art also known as American Standard Code for Information Interchange Art is a graphic design technique that consists pictures pieced together by 95 printable characters. It can be created by any text editor and and is often used with free-form languages. Free-from languages is a language that can be positioned on any line and still be valid.
