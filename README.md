## What is READ.ME?

#### A READ.ME file is a file that keeps information about the other files in the archieve of computer software. It's a form of documentation with just simple text named READ.ME. It is the first file that the user will read when opening a new program or software for the first time. It usually includes instructions or descriptions about the program. Just like this file you are reading right now is a README file explaining what I've learned about my time in this project.

## What is HTML?

#### Hypertext Markup Language, also known as HTML is a data format used to create documents that can be displayed in a web browser or website.

## What is Open-source design methodology?

#### Open-source design is code that is able to see and able to use depending on the license given. Companies usually open-source their code to show how they operate and give a sense of security and ensure consumers that their software is safe to use.

### Creative Computing

#### Creative computing is the inbetween section of creative arts and computing, it includes the community built surrounding it too.

### Physical Computing

#### Physical Computing is using physical objects and interacting with them by programming them from a computer. For this project we used Arduino which is a easy electronic platform that includes tutroials to teach you how to use and interact with these objects. 

# Research

#### To get around our project I did some research and looked at references to get a greater understanding of creative computing. I looked at different projects but these are ones that have stood out to me. 

### Digi-gxl

#### Digi-gxl is a community including womxn, intersex, trans folk and non-binary people that specialises in digital design such as 3D and XR known as extended reality. The platform acts as a agencey that supports networks and under represented creative computing artists to be seen. [Digi-gxl's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/digi.gxl/?hl=en)

### Experiments with Google

#### Experiments with Google is a collection with several open-sources experiments that help us find a balance with technology. It inspires designers to consider the actual wellbeing in their projects that they make. The open-sourced code allows a good base and guide to help designers to try out and reach to new ideas.

### ASCII Art

##### ASCII Art also known as American Standard Code for Information Interchange Art is a graphic design technique that consists pictures pieced together by 95 printable characters. It can be created by any text editor and and is often used with free-form languages. Free-from languages is a language that can be positioned on any line and still be valid.

# Arduino

#### Arduino is 

# Physical Computing

#### On Monday we were taught how to create a circuit that lit up a LED to convey an understanding of Arduino hardware. We watched a tutorial created by Arduino on how to light up the LED and followed along. [Arduino Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT6rF_I5kknMP26rGOy8bDwZs3wbniwU9) By completing the first circuit I was able to gain a sense of how this project is going to go and what I would need to research. As I got home I went onto the Arduino website and started doing the different online projects they had. 

#### [Arduino Tinkercard Lessons](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/project-gallery;collectionId=OMOZACHJ9IR8LRE)

## Project 1: Blink an LED With Digital Output

#### This is a replica of what we did in person. I wanted to try it out again digitally to start getting the hang of how it would be like working with Arduino digitally and to see if the difference is large and if it's easier. This project is just to turn on a LED light however the difference is that instead of doing it physically you would have to code it to turn it on. I added a 500ms pause everytime it would turn on and off so it would go off automatically in a steady pace.

## Project 2: Multiple LEDs

#### I wanted to further my understanding but still keep it basic which is why I tried the multiple LED Arduino board. It had the similar concept as the first but a bit more code was put into it. I was introduced on how to add a variable which was quite interesting.

## Project 3: Keyboard Instrument

#### Finally I wanted to further strengthen my experience with Arduino board so I set up a keyboard instrument that plays 4 notes with different frequencies. I learned about resistor ladders and what they're used for. I really enjoyed this process and set up the frequencies to be the four notes in Mary Had A Little Lamb so I would be able to play it like a piano.

### Resistor Ladders

#### A resistor ladder is an electrical circuit made from repeating units of resistors.

### Instructions

1. Prepare the breadboard by connecting 5V to the power rail and GND to the ground rail;

2. Place the piezo buzzer from on the top left half of the breadboard. Connect the top piezo buzzer to a ground rail and the botoom to the PWM 8.

3. Place 4 buttons on the breadboard, across the center gap, leaving 1 socket between each button. Connect button 1 directly to the 5V rail. Connect the left terminals of the second, third, fourth switches to the 5V rail through resistors using a 220-ohm, 10-kilohm x2 and 1-megohm resistor in that order.

4. Connect the buttons right terminals with wires. Connect the right terminal of button 1 to analog pin A0. Connect the right terminal to button 4 to ground using a 10 k-ohm resistor. 

### Coding Instructions
1. Create a sequence of arrays of frequencies and input it into the code

2. Begin serial communication with the setup function

3. Read and Print the analog value with the loop function

4. Determine which note to play
