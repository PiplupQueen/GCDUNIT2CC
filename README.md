## What is READ.ME?

#### A READ.ME file is a file that keeps information about the other files in the archieve of computer software. It's a form of documentation with just simple text named READ.ME. It is the first file that the user will read when opening a new program or software for the first time. It usually includes instructions or descriptions about the program. Just like this file you are reading right now is a README file explaining what I've learned about my time in this project.

## What is HTML?

#### Hypertext Markup Language, also known as HTML is a data format used to create documents that can be displayed in a web browser or website.

## What is Open-source design methodology?

#### Open-source design is code that is able to see and able to use depending on the license given. Companies usually open-source their code to show how they operate and give a sense of security and ensure consumers that their software is safe to use.

### Creative Computing

#### Creative computing is the inbetween section of creative arts and computing, it includes the community built surrounding it too.

### Physical Computing

#### Physical Computing is using physical objects and interacting with them by programming them from a computer. For this project we used Arduino which is a easy electronic platform that includes tutroials to teach you how to use and interact with these objects. 

# Research

#### To get around our project I did some research and looked at references to get a greater understanding of creative computing. I looked at different projects but these are ones that have stood out to me. 

### Digi-gxl

#### Digi-gxl is a community including womxn, intersex, trans folk and non-binary people that specialises in digital design such as 3D and XR known as extended reality. The platform acts as a agencey that supports networks and under represented creative computing artists to be seen. [Digi-gxl's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/digi.gxl/?hl=en)

### Experiments with Google

#### Experiments with Google is a collection with several open-sources experiments that help us find a balance with technology. It inspires designers to consider the actual wellbeing in their projects that they make. The open-sourced code allows a good base and guide to help designers to try out and reach to new ideas.

### ASCII Art

##### ASCII Art also known as American Standard Code for Information Interchange Art is a graphic design technique that consists pictures pieced together by 95 printable characters. It can be created by any text editor and and is often used with free-form languages. Free-from languages is a language that can be positioned on any line and still be valid.

# Arduino

#### Arduino is 

# Physical Computing

#### On Monday we were taught how to create a circuit that lit up a LED to convey an understanding of Arduino hardware. We watched a tutorial created by Arduino on how to light up the LED and followed along. [Arduino Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT6rF_I5kknMP26rGOy8bDwZs3wbniwU9) By completing the first circuit I was able to gain a sense of how this project is going to go and what I would need to research. As I got home I went onto the Arduino website and started doing the different online projects they had.

## Project 1: Blink an LED With Digital Output

#### This is a replica of what we did in person. I wanted to try it out again digitally to start getting the hang of how it would be like working with Arduino digitally and to see if the difference is large and if it's easier. This project is just to turn on a LED light however the difference is that instead of doing it physically you would have to code it to turn it on. I added a 500ms pause everytime it would turn on and off so it would go off automatically in a steady pace.
