## What is READ.ME?

#### A READ.ME file is a file that keeps information about the other files in the archieve of computer software. It's a form of documentation with just simple text named READ.ME. It is the first file that the user will read when opening a new program or software for the first time. It usually includes instructions or descriptions about the program. Just like this file you are reading right now is a README file explaining what I've learned about my time in this project. 

## What is HTML?

## Creative Computing

#### Creative computing is the inbetween section of creative arts and computing, it includes the community built surrounding it too.

## Physical Computing

#### Physical Computing is using physical objects and interacting with them by programming them from a computer. For this project we used Arduino which is a easy electronic platform that includes tutroials to teach you how to use and interact with these objects.
