# **GCD UNIT 2 CREATIVE COMPUTING PROJECT**

## What is READ.ME?

#### A READ.ME file is a file that keeps the information about the other files in the archive of computer software. It's a form of documentation with just simple text named READ.ME. It is the first file that the user will read when opening a new program or software for the first time. It usually includes instructions or descriptions about the program. Just like this file, you are reading right now is a README file explaining what I've learned about my time in this project.

[Everything you need to know about READ.ME](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/readme-file/)

## What is HTML?

#### Hypertext Markup Language, also known as HTML is a data format used to create documents that can be displayed in a web browser or website.

## What is Open-source design methodology?

#### Open-source design is code that is able to see and able to use depending on the license given. Companies usually open-source their code to show how they operate and give a sense of security and ensure consumers that their software is safe to use.

### Creative Computing

#### Creative computing is the in-between section of creative arts and computing, it includes the community built surrounding it too.

### Physical Computing

#### Physical Computing is using physical objects and interacting with them by programming them from a computer. For this project, we used Arduino which is an easy electronic platform that includes tutorials to teach you how to use and interact with these objects.

# Research

#### To get around our project I did some research and looked at references to get a greater understanding of creative computing. I looked at different projects but these are ones that have stood out to me. 

### Digi-gxl

#### Digi-gxl is a community including womxn, intersex, trans folk and non-binary people that specialises in digital design such as 3D and XR known as extended reality. The platform acts as an agency that supports networks and underrepresented creative computing artists to be seen. [Digi-gxl's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/digi.gxl/?hl=en)

### Experiments with Google

####  Experiments with Google is a collection of several open-source experiments that help us find a balance with technology. It inspires designers to consider the actual well-being of the projects that they make. The open-sourced code allows a good base and guide to help designers to try out and reach new ideas.

### ASCII Art

##### ASCII Art also known as American Standard Code for Information Interchange Art is a graphic design technique that consists of pictures pieced together by 95 printable characters. It can be created by any text editor and is often used with free-form languages. Free-from language is a language that can be positioned on any line and still be valid.

# Arduino

#### Arduino is an open-source software and hardware company that includes user-friendly projects and a community that designs and manufactures sing board microcontrollers and kits for building digital devices.

# Physical Computing

#### On Monday we were taught how to create a circuit that lit up a LED to convey an understanding of Arduino hardware. We watched a tutorial created by Arduino on how to light up the LED and followed along. [Arduino Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT6rF_I5kknMP26rGOy8bDwZs3wbniwU9) By completing the first circuit I was able to gain a sense of how this project is going to go and what I would need to research. As I got home I went onto the Arduino website and started doing the different online projects they had. 

#### [Arduino Tinkercard Lessons](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/project-gallery;collectionId=OMOZACHJ9IR8LRE)

## Project 1: Blink an LED With Digital Output

#### This is a replica of what we did in person. I wanted to try it out again digitally to start getting the hang of how it would be like working with Arduino digitally and to see if the difference is large and if it's easier. This project is just to turn on a LED light however the difference is that instead of doing it physically you would have to code it to turn it on. I added a 500ms pause every time it would turn on and off so it would go off automatically in a steady pace.

## Project 2: Multiple LEDs

#### I wanted to further my understanding but still keep it basic which is why I tried the multiple LED Arduino board. It had a similar concept as the first but a bit more code was put into it. I was introduced to how to add a variable which was quite interesting.

## Project 3: Keyboard Instrument

#### Finally I wanted to further strengthen my experience with Arduino board so I set up a keyboard instrument that plays 4 notes with different frequencies. I learned about resistor ladders and what they're used for. I set up the frequencies to be the four notes in Mary Had A Little Lamb so I would be able to play it like a piano. This was one of my favourite projects I tried out with.

### Resistor Ladders

#### A resistor ladder is an electrical circuit made from repeating units of resistors.

### Instructions

1. Prepare the breadboard by connecting 5V to the power rail and GND to the ground rail;

2. Place the piezo buzzer on the top left half of the breadboard. Connect the top piezo buzzer to a ground rail and the bottom to the PWM 8.

3. Place 4 buttons on the breadboard, across the centre gap, leaving 1 socket between each button. Connect button 1 directly to the 5V rail. Connect the left terminals of the second, third, fourth switches to the 5V rail through resistors using a 220-ohm, 10-kilohm x2 and 1-megohm resistor in that order.

4. Connect the buttons right terminals with wires. Connect the right terminal of button 1 to analog pin A0. Connect the right terminal to button 4 to ground using a 10 k-ohm resistor. 

### Coding Instructions
1. Create a sequence of arrays of frequencies and input it into the code

2. Begin serial communication with the setup function

## Reflection

#### For being a beginner with creative computing and having zero knowledge at the start of the project I believe that I have learned a large amount based on the topic given the time given. I enjoyed working and learning the digital Arduino simulator as I was able to go back and read at a pace I wanted to read. It also allowed me to write down notes and read what they had to say and implement them to notes as if I was watching a video and working on the physical board I would have to play the video over and over just to hear what the person had to say as I may not have caught what the person said. I was also quite excited to learn this project as I have learned a little bit about HTML and Java when I was younger but mostly forgot many things about it and wished I continued working and learning on it more. I thought this would have been a great opportunity for me to revisit this topic and allow me to learn things that I wanted to learn ages ago. After working on this unit it was very interesting to actually get to the centre of what our electronics are made with which are the circuits. It was interesting to understand that even at a time of modernity and filled with electronics, many of us haven't reached the deep end of electronics and learn or play with the circuits within it.

## To improve

#### To improve, I wished that during the Monday class I asked more questions or had a better understanding of what we had to do instead of spending a whole day on Tuesday figuring that out as it wasted a whole day of time that I could have done researching more and work on more Arduino simulation projects. 

## Overview and Conclusion

#### As someone who is new to the field of creative computing I can single-handedly say it will be very scary and intimidating at first but allowing yourself to be open and look at each tutorial, research and the community around it will help realise that they try and make this very welcome for you. This positive community shares sources with each other making it very welcoming especially for newcomers. Look at Digi-gxl's community, it is based on focusing to be a global community reaching out to, womxn, intersex, trans folk and non-binary. The overall atmosphere they have created makes it feel safe and wants you to stay and be able to be open to asking any questions. The community makes a space where it's ok to make mistakes and ask for help which is why open-sourced material is recommended to be looked at to keep the flow of information open and going.
